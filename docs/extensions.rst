    To create a new database protocol implementation, you can start with the
    `template stub implementation <https://github.com/airbnb/omniduct/blob/master/omniduct/databases/stub.py>`_

    implementations are contributed upstream to the official omniduct repository,
    they may be rendered incompatible by future omniduct versions.
