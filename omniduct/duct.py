class Duct(metaclass=InterfaceMeta):
    """
    The abstract base class for all protocol implementations.

    This class defines the basic lifecycle of service connections, along with
    some magic that provides automatic registration of Duct protocol
    implementations. All connections made by `Duct` instances are lazy, meaning
    that instantiation is "free", and no protocol connections are made until
    required by subsequent interactions (i.e. when the value of any attribute in
    the list of `connection_fields` is accessed). All `Ducts` will automatically
    connnect and disconnect as required, and so manual intervention is not
    typically required to maintain connections.
    """

    __doc_attrs = """
        protocol (str): The name of the protocol for which this instance was
            created (especially useful if a `Duct` subclass supports multiple
            protocols).
        name (str): The name given to this `Duct` instance (defaults to class
            name).
        host (str): The host name providing the service (will be '127.0.0.1', if
            service is port forwarded from remote; use `._host` to see remote
            host).
        port (int): The port number of the service (will be the port-forwarded
            local port, if relevant; for remote port use `._port`).
        username (str, bool): The username to use for the service.
        password (str, bool): The password to use for the service.
        registry (None, omniduct.registry.DuctRegistry): A reference to a
            `DuctRegistry` instance for runtime lookup of other services.
        remote (None, omniduct.remotes.base.RemoteClient): A reference to a
            `RemoteClient` instance to manage connections to remote services.
        cache (None, omniduct.caches.base.Cache): A reference to a `Cache`
            instance to add support for caching, if applicable.
        connection_fields (tuple<str>, list<str>): A list of instance attributes
            to monitor for changes, whereupon the `Duct` instance should automatically
            disconnect. By default, the following attributes are monitored:
            'host', 'port', 'remote', 'username', and 'password'.
        prepared_fields (tuple<str>, list<str>): A list of instance attributes to
            be populated (if their values are callable) when the instance first
            connects to a service. Refer to `Duct.prepare` and `Duct._prepare` for
            more details. By default, the following attributes are prepared:
            '_host', '_port', '_username', and '_password'.

        Additional attributes including `host`, `port`, `username` and `password` are
        documented inline.

        Class Attributes:
            AUTO_LOGGING_SCOPE (bool): Whether this class should be used by omniduct
                logging code as a "scope". Should be overridden by subclasses as
                appropriate.
            DUCT_TYPE (Duct.Type): The type of `Duct` service that is provided by
                this Duct instance. Should be overridden by subclasses as
                appropriate.
            PROTOCOLS (list<str>): The name(s) of any protocols that should be
                associated with this class. Should be overridden by subclasses as
                appropriate.
