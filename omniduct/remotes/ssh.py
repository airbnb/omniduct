            fs (FileSystemClient): The FileSystemClient into which the nominated
                file/folder `source` should be downloaded. If not specified,

        Upload files from another filesystem.

        This method (recursively) uploads a file/folder from path `source` on
        filesystem `fs` to the path `dest` on this filesytem, overwriting any
        existing file if `overwrite` is `True`. This is equivalent to
        `fs.download(..., fs=self)`.

        Args:
            source (str): The path on the specified filesystem (`fs`) of the
                file to upload to this filesystem. If `source` ends with '/',
                and corresponds to a directory, the contents of source will be
                copied instead of copying the entire folder.
            dest (str): The destination path on this filesystem. If not
                specified, the file/folder is uploaded into the default path,
                usually one's home folder, on this filesystem. If `dest` ends
                with '/' then file will be copied into destination folder, and
                will throw an error if path does not resolve to a directory.
            overwrite (bool): `True` if the contents of any existing file by the
                same name should be overwritten, `False` otherwise.
            fs (FileSystemClient): The FileSystemClient from which to load the
                file/folder at `source`. If not specified, defaults to the local
                filesystem.
